## 📌 Overview

Electricity theft is a major challenge for power distribution companies, leading to significant financial losses and system inefficiencies. This project presents a **machine learning-based solution** that leverages a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** to identify suspicious electricity consumption patterns and detect potential theft cases.

The model is trained on historical electricity usage data and deployed using a **Streamlit web application** for real-time predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect abnormal electricity consumption patterns
* Classify consumers as **Normal (0)** or **Suspicious/Theft (1)**
* Build a scalable and deployable ML pipeline
* Provide an interactive interface for predictions

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* ✔️ End-to-end ML pipeline implementation
* ✔️ Missing value handling using **Median Imputation**
* ✔️ Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
* ✔️ Class imbalance handling using **SMOTE**
* ✔️ Deep Neural Network (DNN) for classification
* ✔️ Real-time prediction via **Streamlit app**
* ✔️ CSV-based batch prediction support
